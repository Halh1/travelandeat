## Project Planning:
After conceptualizing the project focused on documenting food spots during travel, I created various models to effectively organize the data. By outlining the relationships between these models, I used Trello as a tool for project management, defining and tracking user stories, integratating CRUD functionalities and essential authentication/authorization.
